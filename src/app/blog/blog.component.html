                     With the passage of time, the factory look starts to fade out along with damages
                      and marks all over either it is any vehicle or any sort of products. While the 9h

                    process to keep your love new forever.</p>
                  
                 <h4 style="font-weight: bold; margin-left: 3%;">REASONS OF WHY CAR PAINT LOSES ITS SHINE?</h4>

                <ul style="margin-top: 3%; font-weight: bold;">
                    <li>
                        SUNLIGHT (SPECIFICALLY UV RAYS)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-left: 3%;">The glossy shine of the painted surface of the vehicle could last literally forever if you park 
                    it indoors or place it in the covered parking area for 90 percent of the day. Yes, you might be
                     shocked after reading 90 percent is exactly next to impossible. The main thing that you can perform 
                     so as to add protection to your vehicle while moving out on the road and in the sunlight. The only 
                     thing that you can do as a layman is to park your vehicle in shade or in any of the enclosed garage whenever 
                     it is possible. The other thing that you can do is to use your love less which is again impossible. So, 
                     avoiding sunlight is not the solution but to get something that can protect it from direct exposure to
                      sunlight and the best barrier is getting it wrapped in 9H ceramic coating. 
                      Proper installation of ceramic coating strictly protects your vehicle from any damage 
                      caused by the UV rays- so just a single coat of this vehicle coating 
                    can protect the painted surface of your car from the direct exposure of sunlight.</p>

                         simply use gentler
                         foam brushes which don’t 
                        cause any sort of damage to the surface and is even softer over them.</p>

                             mood but what about your car. Running your vehicle on roads by the shore will surely affect the glamorous look of your car. 
                             The salt compound present in the atmosphere can directly react with the surface of the vehicle for causing oxidation that corrodes
                              the amazing paints and finally results in rusting of the car body. Regular cleaning and frequent car detailing will help you in professionally 
                              removing the layered salt coatings.

                            Pollutants present in the environment can directly lead to the increase in the acid percentage in the rainwater and which will lean slowly towards the acidic
                             parameter on the pH scale. A vehicle which is exposed to the acid rain can easily fade out. The reason behind fading off is the chemical reactions that occur between the car’s painted
                              surface and the rainwater. But you can surely prevent acid rain hampering the exterior surface of your car by two easy steps. As always regular cleaning plays a crucial role and the other one is getting your vehicle coated with 
                              a layer of ceramic coating. This thin and clear layer of ceramic coating can protect your car from all adverse effect caused by acid rain directly falling on the exterior surface.

                        <p style="margin-left: 3%;">
                            Teflon coating is one of the types of different types of car coating prevailing in Indian car detailing market like Nano coating,
                             ceramic coating and paint protection film. It is even known as anti-rust 
                            coating which is manually applied over the exteriors of your car using quality manpower and latest car care equipment. 
                            Teflon is synthesized from fluoropolymer and now has turned generic to the PTFE paint sealant category. The application of Teflon 
                            coating protects the car’s painted surface and brings ultimate shine to exterior 
                            car body by fighting against issues related to corrosion, any wear tear
                             caused by stones chips, bridging shield between car surface and UV rays.

                        <h3 style="margin-left: 3%; font-weight: bold;">Application process of Teflon Coating on the car:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                               <strong>  washing:</strong> The very initial step of car coating is proper washing of car. This process is important to make car free from all sort of contaminants like dirt, grimes 
                                lying over the painted surface and the plastic parts. The segment is washed off easily using a mild soap or car wash shampoo and further it wiped off using steam or
                                 water. Once done with washing process, the car surface is properly wiped using dry 
                                 microfiber towels. Make sure to use a clean cloth so as to avoid any kind of scratch marks over the painted surface of the car.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                               <strong>Polishing:</strong> This step mainly involves the car polish application over the painted car surface. This process is mainly
                                conducted before the application of the Teflon Coating so as to get best possible shine after
                                 coating process is completed. This polishing process can turn the dull car painted surface to shiny one. You can expect better look of older car once this polishing step is properly done and completed. The differences of before and after results of polishing 
                               is easily visible on black and you can easily compare on them.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Teflon Coating:</strong> This is the final step of bringing back of the lost shine of the car along with adding a layer of protection. 
                                    The smell of Teflon is pungent but the result after application is awesome.
                                     The smell slowly disappears as the coating dries up.
                                     A soft cloth is used for Teflon coating application. 
                                    It is left to settle down properly so as to get the best possible outcome.

                            When the Teflon coating liquid is allowed to dry up, it strongly bonds to the car surface. This is the time to use other
                             cotton cloth to apply over the surface and form a thin transparent layer of shiny car coating. 
                             This Teflon coating or say any car coating application is a tough task it demands lots of efforts, patience and time. 
                             Some detailers prefer to manually apply the coating where as there are companies that uses equipment 
                             for every single step so as to bring ease to work, reduce time taken and get ultimate result. Once the detailer
                              finds that the coating has dried up, 
                            they wipe out again using a clean cloth so as to free the surface from any leftover or residual.

                            instantly as this can reduce the applied Teflon Coating thickness. In place of that, they guide you to wash 
                            your car using pH neutral shampoo which is easily available on any auto detailing stores.
