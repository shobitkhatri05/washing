                 <br> <h4>Why Our Customers Love Us</h4>
                  Car owners in India today primarily have two options for Car Detailing and washing:-<br>
                  <br><strong>Authorized Service and Washing Centers of Car Manufacturers</strong>
                <br>They have large infrastructure, in terms of real estate, staff, overheads etc., and they pass on their 
                  higher costs to their customers, who have to settle for heavily overpriced services.<br>

                  <br><strong>Independent Garages & Roadside Garages</strong>
                  <br>While the roadside garages offer cheaper services, they are highly unorganized, usually with labor that is not adequately trained 
                  on the ever-increasing and technologically advanced brands and make of cars today.<br>
                  <br>
                  In both the cases the problem of shoddily done jobs, lack of professionalism, lack of transparency in operations is aplenty. Long wait periods to get an appointment 
                  and to get the job done at the authorized service centers are also very common.
